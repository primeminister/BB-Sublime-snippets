Backbase specific Sublime snippets
==================================

Backbase sublime snippets like gadget namespace tags and jstl/core.
There are two snippet bundles with their own tab completion short code.

Usage:
-----
Put them in your Sublime Text application support folder:
~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User

Then in your editor you have two tab completion shortcodes. One for every snippet bundle:

- type in *'g:'* and hit &lt;tab&gt;
    - g:include
    - g:model
    - g:prefrences
    - g:enumeration prefrence
- type in *'c:'* and hit &lt;tab&gt;
    - c:out
    - c:if
    - c:foreach
    - c:set
